				<h2> About Me </h2>
					<p> My name is Laura Wilkinson and I am a senior at the University of South Carolina, Columbia. Before I attended this university, I lived in a small town right outside of Spartanburg, SC called Roebuck.
					This is a small town but I have lived there basically my whole life. For the first part of my life, I was born in Guatemala but then was soon adopted by my family when I was eight months old. I have lived in the same house with my mom for 18 years of my life. 
					That is when my first move was to move into my freshman dorm room here on campus. I am very close with my mom and she is my best friend. She always comforts me when I am down and always seems to know exactly what to say when I need advice from her. </p><span id="dots"></span>
					<span id="more"> Another big part of who I am is that I am a very athletic person. I did gymnastics from the age of four all the way up until my senior year of highschool. I also was on the varsity cross country team at my highschool for three years. 
					I loved being active and making new friends. Gymnastics was my first and favorite sport I ever did. I was able to travel to many new states and meet so many people whenever I would go to these competitions. 
					This team was a club team and I joined cross country because I wanted to be able to compete for my highschool in some way and they did not offer gymnastics at my highschool. I loved both sports so much and love all the amazing friends I made competing in these sports. </span></p> <button onclick="myFunction()" id="myBtn">See More...</button>

				<h2> My Future Career Plans </h2>
					<p> I am currently completing my undergraduate degree as a Psychology major. I have completed my minor in Women and Gender Studies. I first started out attending this university as a chemical engineering student and after my freshman year I figured out that it was not the major I wanted to do anymore. 
					I loved the work we did and the classes I took. I just knew that the jobs out there were not interesting enough for me to be passionate about this major. I then switched my major to exercise science and was really enjoying it. I was interested in being a physical therapist and thought that was the route I wanted to go. 
					I then realized that I was not as interested in this field and it was hard to think about what my next move would be to further my career. I finally figured out that I love learning about the way the mind works and working one on one with people. I landed on the Psychology major and have loved it ever since.</p><span id="dots2"></span>
					<span id="more2">Once I figured out which major I wanted to do, I was then able to research what kind of job I would want out of college. I realized that what I want to do is take a gap year and work full time and then go back to school to get my masters degree in ABA (Applied Behavior Analyst) Therapy.
					I have been working as a caregiver while I am working on my undergraduate degree and figured out that I love working with people who may have intellectual, mental, or physical disabilities. This is my passion and I am so excited to be able to get my masters and work as an ABA therapist.
					I really feel like I can make a difference in people's lives and help them navigate their lives as well as be a friend for them. </span></p> <button onclick="myFunction2()" id="myBtn2">See More...</button>
